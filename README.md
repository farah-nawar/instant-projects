# instant-projects
This repository contains five instant projects covering various computer vision and machine learning tasks. Each project provides a quick and practical implementation using popular libraries and pretrained models.

# Project 1: Face Detection with OpenCV
## Description
This project demonstrates how to perform face detection to recognize a specific face using the OpenCV library.

## Features
Face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier
Recognition of a specific face using OpenCV's face recognition module

# Project 2: Object Detection with YOLO Pretrained Model
## Description
This project showcases object detection to identify a specific object using a pretrained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model.

## Features
Object detection using the YOLO algorithm
Detection of a specific object within an image or video stream

# Project 3: Emotion Detection with CNN Model
## Description
This project focuses on emotion detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Features
Training a CNN model to recognize facial expressions
Real-time emotion detection from images or video streams

# Project 4: Fire Detection Image Classification with Pretrained Models
## Description
This project presents image classification for fire detection using three pretrained models: EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and ResNet50.

## Features
Training and evaluation of pretrained models for fire detection
Comparison of model performance and accuracy

# Project 5: Recommendation System using Content-Based Filtering
## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a recommendation system based on content-based filtering techniques.

## Features
Building a recommendation system to suggest items based on their content
Utilizing similarity measures to identify relevant items for users
